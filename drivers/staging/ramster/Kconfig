	  Zcache2 doubles RAM efficiency while providing a significant
	  performance boosts on many workloads.  Zcache2 uses
	  compression and an in-kernel implementation of transcendent
	  memory to store clean page cache pages and swap in RAM,
	  providing a noticeable reduction in disk I/O.  Zcache2
	  is a complete rewrite of the older zcache; it was intended to
	  be a merge but that has been blocked due to political and
	  technical disagreements.  It is intended that they will merge
	  again in the future.  Until then, zcache2 is a single-node
	  version of ramster.
